autofonce init
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize project to run the testsuite with autofonce



**DESCRIPTION**


To run tests with **autofonce**, tests typically require
some environment variables to be set. For that, **autofonce** uses a
file named **autofonce.toml** in the project (or **.autofonce**).
**autofonce** will also use this file to create a directory **_autofonce/**
where tests are run and results are kept.

This command can be used to create the file **autofonce.toml**
in the current directory. 

Yet, in some cases, **autofonce** knows the project in which
you are and can provide you with an example of **autofonce.toml** for that
particular project.

You can use the following command to list known projects:
::

  $ autofonce init --list


You can then select the project using:
::

  $ autofonce init -p gnucobol


**autofonce** will also inspect the path to see if it
recognize the name of a project it knows. In such cases, you won't need
to provide the project name, as it is automatically detected.

**USAGE**
::
  
  autofonce init [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`-f` or :code:`--force-update`   Force creation/update if file already exists

* :code:`-l` or :code:`--list-known`   List known projects with environment files

* :code:`-p PROJECT` or :code:`--project PROJECT`   Set project name to infer config


autofonce list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Print testsuite of the current project



**DESCRIPTION**


List the tests, with their numeric identifier, their name and their location in the testsuite files.

autofonce run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run testsuite of the current project



**DESCRIPTION**


Run the testsuite.

**autofonce** expects the existence of either **autofonce.toml** or **.autofonce**.

**autofonce.toml** is required to configure the tests that will be run, depending on the project. Check the following command for more information:
::

  $ autofonce init --help


Before running the tests, you may want to list the test in the current testsuite with:
::

  $ autofonce list --help


To run tests, **autofonce** will create a directory **_autofonce/** in the directory containing the file **autofonce.env**.

Every test is run independantly in a test directory with its number in the **_autofonce/** directory. The test directory is removed if the test does not fail, or if it was expected to fail. Use the **--keep-more** argument to keep directories of tests that have been skipped or were expected to fail. Use the **--keep-all** argument to keep all directories.

You can select which tests to run, by selecting a range of tests using **--after TEST** or **--before TEST**, by selecting individual tests identifiers using **--id NUM** or by selecting keywords using **--keyword KEYWORD**.

**autofonce** will only display failed tests on its output. You can use the argument **--print-all** to display all tests that were not OK, or just read the generated file **_autofonce/results.log**.
